SpaceX Rocket Landing Success Analysis

This project aims to analyze key factors affecting the success of SpaceX rocket landings, particularly the first-stage landing for reuse. By leveraging data sourced from the SpaceX website and Wikipedia, the analysis identifies patterns in launch success based on variables such as launch site, orbit type, payload mass, and proximity to coastal lines. The project utilizes exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling techniques—including Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression—to determine the likelihood of a successful landing.

These insights are designed to assist in optimizing launch strategies and reducing costs for companies in the commercial launch market.
